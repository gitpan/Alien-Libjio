2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped version number to 1.0.3

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added (awful) coverage information.

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added some commands so that the void context paths are touched (increases coverage a bit)

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Various POD updates
	- Overhaul test scripts, remove author tests from Recommends (Alias' journal #5375)
	- Update LICENSE and README (no longer generate a readme, just use a simple one)

2009-07-01  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Revert the change to 02core.t which makes Env::Sanctify::Auto necessary, and remove taint checking for that test

2009-07-01  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Bumped Alien::Libjio version to 1.0.2
	- Upgraded to new libjio 0.51 (released 2009-06-30)
	- There are no Ruby bindings, so remove that from the Build.PL prompt asking if they should be installed

2009-06-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added feature to use gmake if available, and warn the user if on a BSD machine and it is unavailable

2009-06-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added detection for BSD-ish OSes, so that gmake is preferred if available

	Bumped to version 1.0.1

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	No longer enforce "one dot only" in filenames. This breaks compatibility with OpenVMS.

	Updated perlcriticrc with new preferences, removed "no critic" stuff for those in Alien/Libjio.pm

2009-06-14  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added limitation warnings
	- Other minor documentation fixes

2009-06-13  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- A safer ENV{PATH}
	- Don't do ExtUtils::Liblist twice in t/02core.t

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Scalar context doesn't do what it usually does; we should consider returning a string containing all flags (join'd)...

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fix skipped test count

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Skip 3 tests inside SKIP block

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added t/00build.t - I'm still not sure what's causing the Kwalitee test failures though

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added more stuff to make sure the module build successfully

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- The version dependency can be reverted to 0.74
	- Better detection with $ENV{MAKE} etc

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Make sure we tried to build libjio before failing :-)

2009-06-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Update README
	- Added t/00build.t test to make sure the build process completed successfully, or fail otherwise (this way we can see which libjio instances fail to build from source, via CPAN Testers)

2009-06-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Changed the abstract

2009-06-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-06-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Fixes to dependencies (Build.PL, META.yml)
	- Added code to handle extra installs if people want (stuff like the Python/Ruby bindings, etc.) rather than just the core libjio stuff

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Changed the defined() test to can()

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Silenced some nonsensical Perl::Critic warnings

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fixed minor issue making ->installed set to true unexpectedly (did not check both definedness and length of string)

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Removed the exception when libjio isn't found -- that's what ->installed is for

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Set 'installed' property to 0 by default, so that the test will return false

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added code to trap warnings emitted by ExtUtils::Liblist when libjio isn't found

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added some error checking code

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Unfortunately, it looks like ExtUtils::PkgConfig doesn't deal too well with errors.

	Fixed minor oops

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added a subclass to install libjio

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Remember to 'use' ExtUtils::PkgConfig
	- Add code to install libjio during Build.PL

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added a basic META.yml

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Suppress a warning from perlcritic
	- Work with getconf using open3 rather than backticks

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Used ExtUtils::PkgConfig instead of doing stuff by hand

2009-06-09  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>
